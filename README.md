## 🎨 UI/UX Philosophy
The UI was explicitly designed to break away from traditional, sterile educational software. It utilizes a **Premium Dark/Orange Theme** featuring:
- Glassmorphism effects and ambient glowing backgrounds.
- Pill-shaped components and smooth hover micro-interactions.
- Standardized, spacious grid layouts to ensure dense data readability without cognitive overload.
